# Simple Storage Ethers

This is part of the FreeCodeCamp Solidity & Javascript Blockchain Course.

## Setup

Install

```
yarn
```

## Usage

1. Run your ganache local chain, by hitting `quickstart` on your ganache application

> Save the workspace. This way, next time you open ganache you can start the workspace you've created, otherwise you'll have to redo all the steps below.
2. Copy the `RPC SERVER` sting in your ganache CLI, and place it into your `.env` file


`.env` Example:

```
RPC_URL=http://0.0.0.0:8545
```

3. Hit the key on one of the accounts, and copy the key you see and place it into your `.env` file

`.env` Example:

PRIVATE_KEY=11ee3108a03081fe260ecdc106554d09d9d1209bcafd46942b10e02943effc4a

4. Compile your Solidity code

Run

```
yarn hardhat compile
```

or 

```
yarn compile
```

You'll see files `SimpleStorage_sol_SimpleStorage.abi` and `SimpleStorage_sol_SimpleStorage.bin` be created.


5. Run your code

```
ts-node deploy.ts
```

### Deploying to a testnet

Make sure you have a [metamask](https://metamask.io/) or other wallet, and export the private key.

**IMPORTANT**

USE A METAMASK THAT DOESNT HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS IN IT. Just in case you accidentally push your private key to a public place. I _highly_ recommend you use a different metamask or wallet when developing.

1. [Export your private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key) and place it in your `.env` file, as done above.

2. Go to [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981) and create a new project on the testnet of choice (ie, kovan or Rinkeby)
3. Grab your URL associated with the testnet, and place it into your `.env` file.
4. Make sure you have [testnet ETH](https://faucets.chain.link/) in your account. You can [get some here.](https://faucets.chain.link/). You should get testnet ETH for the same testnet that you made a project in Alchemy (ie, Rinkeby or Kovan)
5. Run

```
ts-node deploy.ts
```
